          <p>At the end of January, I had an epiphany.</p>
          
          <p>Kim and I were sitting in the living room one evening, relaxed in our easy chairs, both reading books. All four of our
          beasts were nestled nearby. The house was quiet. For the first time in forever, I felt completely content.</p>
          
          <p>For maybe twenty minutes, I paused what I was doing and simply savored the moment. I stopped. I looked around. I made
          time to be present in the Now.</p>
          
          <p>Eventually, my mind began to wander. “When was the last time I was this happy?” I wondered. I thought back to the late
          1990s when my ex-wife and I lived in similar circumstances. Kris and I would read together in the evening, each with a
          cat in our laps. Life was simpler. I felt no anxiety. I was happy.</p>
          
          Then too, I achieved a similar level of contentment as recently as 2013. Soon after Kris I got divorced, Kim and I began
          dating. I lived alone in an apartment. My life wasn't filled with obligations and Stuff. Again, things were simpler.
          Simpler and saner and more filled with joy.
          
          “But what really is the difference between those two periods of time and the last few years?” I thought. “Why have I
          been so anxious recently?”
          
          The difference, I realized, has a lot to do with my expectations.
